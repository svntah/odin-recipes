    <p>This is the receipe for lasagna:
        First your going to want to go to the store.
        Next you are going to pre purchase the lasagna because you cannot cook.
        Flip the frozen lasaagne over, and bake it as the paper says.
        Usually you will have to take some sort of wrapper off.... Please do it I've learn that itll explode otherwhise. 
        Boom serve and ur done! Thank me later, you werent goingto cook a lasagna anyway.
